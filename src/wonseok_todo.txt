1) check link status update links status (up/down) and update graph 
2) get link delays (for all up links)
   - in links dict, hosts' port is -1. Is it should be 1?
3) get link bw being used (for all up links)

4) normalise delay values 
5) normalize bw values
6) efficency = alpha*bw_norm + beta*delay_norm
7) update graph edge with efficency value



======= sumved todo =======

delete all old flow ids from previous path
add flows for each device in path


intent flow delay 
intent flow bandwidth
