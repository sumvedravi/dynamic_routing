1) check link status update links status (up/down) and update graph 
2) get link delays (for all up links)
   - in links dict, hosts' port is -1. Is it should be 1?
   - in links dict, add 'bw_before' to keep tracking diff bw(bps)
3) get link bw being used (for all up links)
   - iperf can not increase delay ping test from swtich 
   - iperf can     increase delay ping test from host 
   - switch network namesapce same with host, but host network namespace is virtual network namespace.
   - use host1 - host2 delay for switch1 - switch2
   - assume host - switch delay 0.050ms(estimated avg value) by adding link_delay_default.log
4) normalise delay values 
5) normalize bw values
6) efficency = alpha*bw_norm + beta*delay_norm
7) update graph edge with efficency value



======= sumved todo =======

delete all old flow ids from previous path
add flows for each device in path


intent flow delay 
intent flow bandwidth
